# Interval Tree Project

## Project Overview
This project implements an **Interval Tree**, a data structure used to store a set of intervals and efficiently query all intervals that contain a given key. The structure is particularly useful for range-based queries, where you need to find all intervals that overlap with a specific value.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. **Input Intervals**:
   - In the first text box, enter intervals in the format: `2 5,6 8,10 15`.
   - Example: For intervals `[2,5]` and `[6,8]`, enter `2 5,6 8`.
3. **Build the Tree**:
   - Click the **Add Intervals** button to construct the interval tree.
   - The tree will be displayed below.
4. **Query the Tree**:
   - In the second text box, enter a query key (e.g., `7`).
   - Click the **Find** button to execute the query.
5. **View Results**:
   - The intervals containing the query key will be displayed at the bottom.
   - The path followed during the query will be highlighted in the tree visualization.
6. **Refresh the Page**:
   - To create a new tree, refresh the page and repeat the steps.
